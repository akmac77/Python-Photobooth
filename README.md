# Python-powered Photobooth

These scripts power a photobooth by controlling a DSLR from a Raspberry Pi.

1. Guests strike a pose and step on a Big Red Button™ :red_circle:
2. LEDs flash to draw attention to the camera lens
3. Camera takes the picture
4. Picture is displayed on-screen for immediate viewing.
5. RAW image stays on camera for later retrieval
